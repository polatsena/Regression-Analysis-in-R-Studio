A wine factory producing Pinot Noir aims to analyze wine quality using regression analysis. They imported Pinot Noir grapes from various regions and recorded data on aroma, taste, and body of the wines. The analysis was performed using R Studio.
First, exploratory data analysis was conducted. Then, the necessary assumptions for regression analysis were checked, and a model was built. Subsequently, the significance of model parameters was examined, and confidence intervals were established. Potential violations of assumptions in regression analysis were investigated. Lastly, variable selection was performed, and a ridge regression model was constructed.
